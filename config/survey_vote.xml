<p>One last thing.  You and the other players will vote on whether you want to leave the payoffs as they are, or you can vote to redistribute the payoffs.  If a majority of the players vote to <b>leave the payoffs as they are</b>, then the game ends and everyone is paid the amounts shown at the end of the final round.  If a majority of players vote to <b>redistribute payoffs</b>, then each player will pay a percentage of their payoffs into a pot that will then be divided among the players such that the player with the lowest payoff gets some of the funds from the player with the highest payoff.</p>

<p>If you want to redistribute payoffs, you also get to vote on how you will redistribute the payoffs.  You can either have <b>every player donate an equal percentage</b> of their payoffs to the pot, or you can have the <b>player with the highest payoff donate a higher percentage</b> of their payoff to the pot.</p>
